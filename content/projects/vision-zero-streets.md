This site is intended to be a very pared-down, simple resource for urban planners interested in creating complete streets. [Visit the site](https://www.visionzerostreets.org). 

## Planning

The web component of this project was mostly based on a PDF version of this report created by the talented [J Oberman](http://cargocollective.com/jobermandesign), but it translated very well to HTML.

## Build

Rather than starting from scratch, I began with the [Grayscale](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/) template and began adding content from the printed report, making use of the handy circular image Bootstrap classes. The site also features some Font Awesome icons in the street redesign comparison section.

## Launch

The site was linked to in articles in [AM New York](http://www.amny.com/transit/nyc-should-change-street-redesign-approach-transportation-alternatives-says-1.12812828) and [StreetsBlog](http://nyc.streetsblog.org/2017/01/03/t-a-vision-zero-demands-bolder-street-designs-from-city-hall-and-dot/).
