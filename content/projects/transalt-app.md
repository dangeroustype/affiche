The idea for a phone app was one that the team had kicked around for a few years, but the main problem was that we didn't have enough content to push to the app. However, once the blog began to be regularly updated, the idea resurfaced again.

I set out to build a cross-platform app using React Native, having built a few web apps using vanilla React.

The build system definitely took some getting used toâ€”Gradle and Cocoapods were terra incognita, but the app came together in a few months.

See the app on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/transalt/id1364992964) or [Google Play](ttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.transportationalternatives.transalt&hl=en). Take a look at the [code](https://github.com/dangeroustype/transalt-app).
