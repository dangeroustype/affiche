I'm a web developer with a great deal of experience in the nonprofit sector, and I'm motivated to use technology to help create progressive social change. The majority of my work has involved content management systems like WordPress and Drupal, but I also have experience building projects in React and React Native.

I grew up on a 20-acre farm in Northern California, but I've lived in New York City for nearly a decade. When I'm not working on web projects, I try to stay busy learning to speak new languages, biking around the city, and tending to my ever-growing collection of houseplants.

When I'm not working on web projects or my hobbies, I'm just trying to find the right pumpkin.
